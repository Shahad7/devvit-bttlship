Game Description: A recreation of the classic Battleship game designed as a single-player challenge. The game features a 10Ã—10 grid with ships randomly placed at the start of each round. Players must locate and sink all ships as efficiently as possible. The leaderboard tracks player performance based on completion time. Each new game generates a fresh ship layout to ensure variety and replayability. Could be scheduled to be posted in a subreddit with random gameboard each time

Also a feature where players can themselves place ships on the gameboard and creating new games can be added later if feasible
