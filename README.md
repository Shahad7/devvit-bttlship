Game name : BattleShip

Game Description: A recreation of the classic Battleship game designed as a single-player challenge. The game features a 10Ã—10 grid with ships randomly placed at the start of each round. Players must locate and sink all ships as efficiently as possible. The leaderboard tracks player performance based on completion time. Each new game generates a fresh ship layout to ensure variety and replayability. The game could be scheduled to post in subreddits with a random gameboard each time.

Additionally, a feature allowing players to place their own ships on the gameboard and create custom games could be added later if feasible.
